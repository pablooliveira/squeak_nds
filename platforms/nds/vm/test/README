Here is a working small squeak image that you can test 
with squeak vm for nds.

To make a fat image that you can use with desmume:

dd if=/dev/zero of=test1.image bs=1048576 count=10
mkdosfs -F16 test1.image
mount -o loop test1.image <mount_point>
cp squeak.image squeak.changes <mount_point>
umount <mount_point>

then run 'make test' in platforms/nds/vm/
